<h1>Luke Canepari</h1>

<p>I'm working on an English degree right now. My hope is to work in the gaming industry as a story/character writer.</p>

<p>I love reading and writing, I also really love the outdoors. Fishing, camping, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>I've also gained a new love for coding!</p>

<p>I'm married, my wife and I just celebrated our one year anniversary this last December</p>
<p>We just had our first baby, a boy. He's about two months old now and he's the most sweet and adorable little goblin you'd ever meet!</p>

<p>I am really hoping to build a career in web design and development as well as cyber security.</p>
<p>I'm also hoping to use my English skills in a UI/UX feild.</p>

<p>I've been a member of the church my entire life. My favorite quote is also my favorite scripture:</p>
<p>"This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you." -Jesus Christ, John 15:12</p>

<p>I'm really looking forward to learning with all of you!</p>
