            Hey everyone, I've been hiking this summer and got this awesome picture!
            It really is great to get an early start on hikes. We havn't had to deal with any foot trafic and the views with the sunrise have been perfect.

            We're very excited to announce a new event! The Yosmite National Park is a great place to visit, and we hope to see you there.
            We're planning a week long trip spanning several hikes through the park, with the half dome being the final stop. More details will
            be posted soon.
