      <p>Welcome to EmergencyPrep! This sight is meant to be your guide to new experiences and knowledge. If you’ve ever wanted to try a new experience or to build a budding talent, this community is the place to help you do just that.</p>
      <p>This site is also a place where you can learn the ins and outs of emergency preparedness and skill building for the future. If you’ve ever wanted to try learning more about things like how to fix a car, flint napping, carpentry, financing, or any other life skills you feel you’re lacking experience or understanding in, then this is the place to be.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if you feel that you have all the skill you need for your day-to-day life, but you’re worried about an ever-changing world and what might happen in an uncertain future, then this site can help you master skills that go beyond mere hobbies.</p>
      <p>I’m an eagle scout that grew up in the Boy Scouts of America program, I also loved reading books like The Dangerous Book for Boys as a kid. These kinds of experiences and literature filled me with excitement and a desire to learn and experience new things. Unfortunately, I never personally got the chance to experience all the things I’ve wanted, but I realized that I could share some of the experience I’ve gained, and you can too!</p>
      <p>You might not feel like you know a lot, but no one knows everything, meanwhile, everyone knows something. That includes you! So, check out the Survivors Handbook if you’re interested in learning something new, or if you want to share some of your own experience or knowledge, feel free to add a post to your own blog!

      <h3>Survivor's Handbook</h3>
      <p>The Survivor’s handbook is a catalogued and curated compilation of knowledge and skills. It contains a variety of subjects and is filled with open source and shared knowledge and experience just for you!
      <p>Crash Course on First Aid:</p>
      <p>Accidents are going to happen. You can’t spend your life worrying about them or you’d never get anything done. However, using common sense and taking a few simple precautions is well worth a little of your time. Really, everyone should have a basic knowledge of first aid. If you were injured, you’d want someone close to you who doesn’t panic and knows what to do. It’s not being dramatic to say a little knowledge can make the difference between life and death.</p>
      <p>When dealing with more than one casualty, a decision has to be made about which person to treat first. This process is called “triage.” One rule of thumb is that if someone is screaming, they are clearly alive, conscious and almost certainly in less danger than someone silent and still.</p>
      <p>These are your priorities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Breathing and heartbeat.</li>
        <li>Stop bleeding.</li>
        <li>Bandage wounds.</li>
        <li>Splint fractures.</li>
        <li>Treat shock.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Hi there, my name’s Luke! I’m a bit of a history buff and I think people can learn a lot from history. I thought my first post could be something that a lot of people have heard of but not so many people have read, The Gettysburg Address:</p>
      <p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>
      <p>But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</p>
